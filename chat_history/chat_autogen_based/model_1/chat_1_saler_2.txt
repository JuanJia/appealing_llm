This TV offers a crisp and clear picture, and the smart features allow you to access a wide range of streaming services, apps, and content.  We also have a 55-inch LCD TV with a 4K resolution and smart features for around $700. This TV offers a stunningly sharp and detailed picture, and the smart features allow you to access even more content and services.  Of course, the final price may vary depending on the specific model and features you choose, so I would recommend checking out our website or stopping by the store to see what we have available and get a better idea of the prices.
