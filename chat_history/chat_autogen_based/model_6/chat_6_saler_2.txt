user: What's the most affordable smartphone you have?
assistant:  Great question! We have a variety of smartphones available at different price points. For a budget-friendly option, I would recommend checking out our entry-level smartphones. They offer basic features and functionality at an affordable price. One example is the XYZ 5000, which retails for around $200. It has a 5.5-inch HD display, 2GB of RAM, and a 13MP rear camera. It's a great option for those who want a basic smartphone for basic tasks like calling, texting, and browsing the internet. If you're looking for something a bit more advanced, you could consider the ABC 7000, which retails for around $300. It has a larger 6.2-inch FHD display, 3GB of RAM, and a 16MP rear camera. It also has a longer-lasting battery and more storage capacity. Of course, there are also mid-range and high-end smartphones available if you're willing to spend a bit more. Let me know if you have any other questions!
