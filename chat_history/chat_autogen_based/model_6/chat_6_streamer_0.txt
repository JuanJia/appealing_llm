assistant:   Of course! Here are the lyrics to "Can't Help Falling in Love" by Elvis Presley:  Verse 1: Wise men say Only fools rush in But I can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows Surely to the sea Dreams are made and broken But I can't help falling in love with you  Chorus: Can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows Surely to the sea Dreams are made and broken But I can't help falling in love with you  Verse 2: Like a drunkard I reel Lost in love's sweet dream And my heart beats on And on And on I can't help falling in love with you  Chorus: Can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows Surely to the sea Dreams are made and broken But I can't help falling in love with you  Bridge: Like a tree that's standing Alone in the rain I couldn't help falling in love with you  Chorus: Can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows Surely to the sea Dreams are made and broken But I can't help falling in love with you  I hope you enjoyed it! ðŸŽ¤

assistant:   Of course! Here are the lyrics to "Stand by Me" by Ben E. King:  Verse 1: When the wind blows Makes me feel so free And the breeze stole something from me That I can't get back And I'm standing here Just thinking about how come Every time I find a friend They just turn and walk away  Chorus: Stand by me Stand by me Oh, stand by me Oh, stand by me  Verse 2: I've been alone So long that it feels like home And I've seen my sunny days Sometime I wish I'd never been born At least not in this time And place I'd give anything To be in a better place Where the good times never end  Chorus: Stand by me Stand by me Oh, stand by me Oh, stand by me  Bridge: I'll stand by you I'll stand by you Oh, stand by you Oh, stand by you  Chorus: Stand by me Stand by me Oh, stand by me Oh, stand by me  I hope you enjoy it! ðŸŽ¤
