I encourage an open-door policy and strive to be available to address questions, concerns, or provide guidance as needed.  Overall, my approach to mentoring is focused on fostering a collaborative and supportive relationship with my students, while also setting clear expectations and providing the necessary resources to help them succeed in their research endeavors.
