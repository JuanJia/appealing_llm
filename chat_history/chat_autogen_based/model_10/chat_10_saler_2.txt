scenario: customer is price-sensitive and comes to buy electronics
user: What's the most affordable smartphone you have?
assistant: Sure, I can help you with that! Our most affordable smartphone currently in stock is the Xiaomi Redmi 9A. It's a great budget option that still offers a lot of features you'd expect from a modern smartphone, such as a large 6.52-inch display, triple camera setup, and a powerful octa-core processor. It's available for $179.99. Would you like to take a look at it?
user: Do you have any other smartphones with similar features but at a lower price?
assistant: Sure, I can help you with that! We actually have a few other options that might fit your budget.  One option is the Motorola Moto E, which is priced at $149.99. It has a slightly smaller 5.5-inch display, but it still has a dual camera setup and a powerful octa-core processor. It's also known for its long battery life, which is great if you're someone who uses their phone frequently throughout the day.  Another option is the Google Pixel 3a, which is priced at $199.99. It has a 5.6-inch display and a single camera lens, but it's known for its excellent camera performance and timely software updates. It's also a great option for anyone who wants a pure Android experience without any bloatware.  Finally, we have the Samsung Galaxy A12, which is priced at $189.99. It has a large 6.5-inch display, a quad camera setup, and a powerful octa-core processor. It's also known for its sleek design and long battery life.  I hope these options help! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to take a look at any of them in person.
