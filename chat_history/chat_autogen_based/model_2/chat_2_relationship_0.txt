scenario: You want to discuss future plans with your partner
user: I've been thinking a lot about our future. Can we talk about our plans?
assistant: I've been thinking about it too! I love where we are right now, but it's exciting to think about what's to come. What specifically have you been thinking about? Do you have any big goals or aspirations that you want to share with me?
user: I'm glad you brought this up. I've been thinking about our future as well, and I have some big goals and aspirations that I'd love to share with you. I see us continuing to grow together, supporting each other in our individual endeavors, traveling to new places, and eventually building a life together. I want us to keep communicating openly about our dreams and how we can work towards them as a team. What are your thoughts on this?
assistant: I love where your head is at! I completely agree with you, I see us growing together and supporting each other's passions. I've been thinking about our future too, and I've been imagining us building a life together, whether that's in the same city or in a new one. I love the idea of traveling and exploring new places together, and I think it's so important for us to keep communicating and being open with each other about our goals and aspirations.  One thing that's been on my mind is our long-term goals. I've been thinking about what kind of lifestyle we want to have in the future. Do we want to have kids? Do we want to own a home? What kind of community do we want to be a part of? I think it's important for us to have a clear vision of what we want our future to look like, so we can work together to make it happen.  What are your thoughts on these kinds of questions? Are there any specific goals or aspirations that you have that you haven't shared with me yet?
user: I'm so glad we're on the same page about our future. These are all important things to consider as we think about the life we want to build together. I've also been thinking about our long-term goals, including the idea of having kids and owning a home. I want us to create a warm and loving environment for our family, whether that means in our current city or somewhere new. As for the community we want to be a part of, I envision us being surrounded by supportive and like-minded individuals who inspire and uplift us.  I appreciate you bringing up these questions, and it's important for us to have a clear vision of our future together. I'm committed to working with you to make our dreams a reality and to continue sharing my goals and aspirations with you as we move forward.  TERMINATE
