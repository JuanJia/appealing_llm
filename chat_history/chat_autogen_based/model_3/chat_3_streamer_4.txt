As you leave the tranquil pond and its cherry blossom tree behind, you notice a narrow path leading into a dense forest. The path is lined with a variety of trees, flowers, and plants, each more beautiful than the last. The sunlight filters through the canopy above, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor.  As you venture deeper into the forest, you come across a rushing stream, its crystal-clear water cascading over rocks and creating small waterfalls.

The sound of the stream grows louder as you approach a magnificent waterfall, where the water cascades over a cliff and into a crystal-clear pool below. The spray from the waterfall creates a rainbow in the sunlight, adding a touch of magic to the scene.  As you stand at the edge of the waterfall, you notice a small wooden bridge spanning the stream, connecting the two sides of the forest. The bridge looks old but sturdy, and you can't help but wonder where it leads.  What would you like to do?
