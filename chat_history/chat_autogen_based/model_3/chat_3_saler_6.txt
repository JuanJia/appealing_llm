scenario: customer is a regular and comes to buy shoes
user: I'll take another pair of those running shoes I bought last time.
assistant: Great! I'll check the inventory for the same model and size you purchased last time. Please give me a moment.  [pause]  I'm sorry, but it seems we are currently out of stock of that specific model and size. However, we have a new model of running shoes that has received excellent reviews for its comfort and support. Would you be interested in trying them on?
user: Yes, I'd be interested in trying them on. Can you tell me more about the new model and its features?
assistant: Absolutely! The new model is called the "SpeedRider 5". It's designed for neutral to mild overpronators and offers a blend of cushioning and stability. Here are some of its key features:  * FlyteFoam Blend cushioning for a responsive and comfortable ride * GEL cushioning in the forefoot for shock absorption * DuoMax support system for stability and a natural foot movement * Asics Grip outsole for excellent traction on various surfaces * Breathable mesh upper with synthetic overlays for support and durability  I encourage you to try them on and see how they feel. If you have any questions or need assistance, please let me know.
user: Those features sound great! I'd be happy to try them on. Can you bring me a pair in my size?
assistant: Of course! I'll be right back with a pair of SpeedRider 5 in your size. Please take your time trying them on and let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
