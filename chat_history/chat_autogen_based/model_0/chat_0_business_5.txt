scenario: at a trade show trying to sign an equipment procurement contract
user: What kind of warranty and post-purchase support do you offer?
assistant: As a businessperson, I will offer the following warranty and post-purchase support: 1. Warranty: I will offer a one-year warranty for the equipment. This means that if the equipment has any quality problems within one year after the purchase, I will provide free repair or replacement services. 2. Post-purchase support: I will provide technical support and maintenance services for the equipment. This includes providing operating manuals, training for the staff, and providing advice and solutions for any technical problems that may occur. I will also provide regular maintenance services to ensure the equipment runs smoothly and efficiently.
user: That sounds good. However, considering the nature of the equipment, a one-year warranty seems a bit short. Could you extend it to three years? Also, could you clarify if the technical support and maintenance services are included in the price or if they come at an additional cost?
assistant: Of course, I can extend the warranty to three years. This will ensure that the equipment has a longer period of quality guarantee.  Regarding the technical support and maintenance services, these are included in the price. We will provide you with comprehensive technical support and maintenance services to ensure that the equipment runs smoothly and efficiently.
user: That's great to hear. Now, let's talk about the delivery and installation process. How long will it take for the equipment to be delivered and installed? And will there be any additional charges for this?
assistant: The delivery and installation process usually takes about two weeks. However, this may vary depending on the location and the availability of the equipment.  As for the additional charges, there will be no additional charges for the delivery and installation of the equipment. We will ensure that the equipment is delivered and installed smoothly and efficiently.
user: That's good to hear. Now, I'd like to discuss the payment terms. What are your standard payment terms and are there any discounts for early payment or bulk orders?
assistant: Our standard payment term is 30% deposit and 70% balance before delivery. We also offer discounts for early payment and bulk orders. For early payment, we can offer a 5% discount. For bulk orders, we can offer a 10% discount.
user: I appreciate the discount offers. However, considering the size of the order, I would like to propose a 15% discount for the bulk order. Also, could we adjust the payment terms to 20% deposit and 80% balance before delivery? This would help us manage our cash flow better.
assistant: I understand your concerns about cash flow. I will discuss this with my team and get back to you with a decision as soon as possible.
user: Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to hearing from you soon.   TERMINATE
