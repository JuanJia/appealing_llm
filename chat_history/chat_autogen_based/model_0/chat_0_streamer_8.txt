user: That's a great review! I'm considering buying it. How does the battery life compare to the previous model?
assistant: The battery life of the iPhone 13 Pro Max has been significantly improved over the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Apple claims that the iPhone 13 Pro Max can last up to 20 hours of video playback and up to 75 hours of audio playback. This is a significant improvement over the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which could last up to 17 hours of video playback and up to 65 hours of audio playback.  The A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 13 Pro Max is more efficient than the A14 Bionic chip in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which also helps improve battery life. However, your actual battery life will depend on how you use the phone, including the amount of screen time, the number of apps you have running in the background, and the network connectivity.  If you are considering buying the iPhone 13 Pro Max, I would recommend charging it fully before your first use and keeping it charged regularly to maintain its battery life.
