scenario: at a trade show trying to sign a software development contract, but the client is very picky
user: Can you guarantee the software will meet all our specific requirements?
assistant: I'd be happy to discuss that with you. Our team of experts has thoroughly reviewed your requirements, and we're confident that we can deliver a software solution that meets all your needs.  In fact, we've developed a detailed scope of work that outlines exactly how we plan to address each of your requirements. We've also identified potential risks and developed mitigation strategies to ensure that we stay on track.  That being said, I want to assure you that we're committed to delivering a high-quality software solution that meets your expectations. To provide an added layer of assurance, we're willing to include a clause in the contract that guarantees our work.  Specifically, we propose a phased delivery approach, with regular check-ins and demos to ensure that the software is meeting your requirements at each stage. If, at any point, you're not satisfied with the progress, we'll work with you to address any issues and make necessary adjustments.  Additionally, we're willing to offer a warranty period of 90 days after delivery, during which time we'll provide unlimited support and maintenance to ensure that any issues that arise are addressed promptly.  So, while I can't provide an absolute guarantee, I'm confident that our team's expertise, combined with our phased delivery approach and warranty period, will give you the assurance you need that we'll deliver a software solution that meets all your specific requirements.

In terms of feedback, we encourage you to provide input and feedback throughout the development process. We'll provide you with a clear and concise feedback mechanism, which will allow you to submit comments, suggestions, and concerns.

user: It seems like you've addressed my concerns quite thoroughly. Let's discuss the pricing and payment schedule for this project.
assistant: I'm glad we've been able to address your concerns.  Regarding pricing and payment schedule, we've developed a customized proposal that takes into account the scope of work, timeline, and resources required to deliver the software solution.  Our proposed pricing model is a fixed-price model, which means that we'll provide a fixed price for the entire project. This model provides you with cost certainty and ensures that you know exactly what you'll be paying for the project.  The total project cost is $250,000, which includes all the features and functionalities we've discussed, as well as the support and maintenance services I mentioned earlier.  In terms of payment schedule, we propose the following:  * 20% deposit upon signing of the contract ($50,000) * 30% payment upon completion of the design phase ($75,000) * 30% payment upon completion of the development phase ($75,000) * 20% payment upon delivery of the final product ($50,000)  We also offer a discount for upfront payment, which would reduce the total project cost to $230,000.  Additionally, we're open to discussing alternative payment schedules or models that may better suit your needs. Our goal is to find a mutually beneficial agreement that works for both parties.  It's worth noting that our pricing is competitive, and we're confident that the value we'll deliver will far exceed the cost of the project. We're committed to delivering a high-quality software solution that meets your needs and exceeds your expectations.  What are your thoughts on the pricing and payment schedule? Is there anything you'd like to discuss or negotiate?
