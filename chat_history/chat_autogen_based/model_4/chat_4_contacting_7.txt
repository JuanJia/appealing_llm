scenario: student asks about research funding opportunities
user: Hi there! I can certainly discuss funding opportunities. Are you looking for information on specific grants or general funding availability?
assistant:  I'm looking for information on the grants available for students. 
user: There are various grants available for students, including federal grants like the Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), and Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant.
