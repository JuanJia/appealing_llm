It makes a huge difference in flavor.     2. **Prep Ahead:** Chop, measure, and organize all your ingredients before you start cooking.

For instance, sear meats on high heat to lock in juices and reduce to low for simmering sauces.  4. **Taste as You Go:** Don‚Äôt be afraid to taste your dish as you cook. Adjust the seasoning gradually to suit your taste.  5. **Let it Rest:** If you‚Äôre cooking meat, let it rest for a few minutes before cutting.
